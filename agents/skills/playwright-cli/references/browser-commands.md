# Browser Commands

Consult only when the [common path](../SKILL.md#common-browser-task) lacks a
needed command or option; advanced session setup is not a prerequisite. The
[root safety rules](../SKILL.md#safety-and-ownership) apply to every example.
Commands below omit `-s` for brevity: add `-s=<task-session>` to each command,
or set `PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_SESSION` to your task-owned session. Example refs such
as `e5` and tab indices are placeholders; replace them from current output.
`open`/`close` examples require a task-owned isolated browser. For the user's
Brave, attach/detach instead and work in the intended tab.

playwright-cli request 5
playwright-cli run-code "async page => await page.context().grantPermissions(['geolocation'])"
playwright-cli run-code --filename=script.js
playwright-cli tracing-start
playwright-cli tracing-stop

# record user actions in the browser, print them as Playwright code on stop
playwright-cli recording-start
playwright-cli recording-stop

playwright-cli video-start video.webm
playwright-cli video-chapter "Chapter Title" --description="Details" --duration=2000
playwright-cli video-stop

# annotate each subsequent action (click, type, ...) with a callout naming the action and highlighting the target
playwright-cli video-show-actions --duration=600 --position=top-right
playwright-cli video-hide-actions

# launch the dashboard for UI review / design feedback — user annotates the page, you receive the annotated screenshot, snapshot, and notes
playwright-cli show --annotate

# generate a Playwright locator for an element from its ref or selector
playwright-cli generate-locator e5 --raw

# show a persistent highlight overlay for an element, optionally with a custom style
playwright-cli highlight e5
playwright-cli highlight e5 --style="outline: 3px dashed red"
# hide a single element highlight, or all page highlights when no target is given
playwright-cli highlight e5 --hide
playwright-cli highlight --hide
```

## Raw output

The global `--raw` option strips page status, generated code, and snapshot sections from the output, returning only the result value. Use it to pipe command output into other tools. Commands that don't produce output return nothing.

```bash
playwright-cli --raw eval "JSON.stringify(performance.timing)" | jq '.loadEventEnd - .navigationStart'
playwright-cli --raw eval "JSON.stringify([...document.querySelectorAll('a')].map(a => a.href))" > links.json
playwright-cli --raw snapshot > before.yml
playwright-cli click e5
playwright-cli --raw snapshot > after.yml
diff before.yml after.yml
TOKEN=$(playwright-cli --raw cookie-get session_id)
playwright-cli --raw localstorage-get theme
```

For structured output wrapping every reply as JSON, pass --json
```bash
playwright-cli list --json
```

## Open parameters
```bash
# Use specific browser when creating session
playwright-cli open --browser=chrome
playwright-cli open --browser=firefox
playwright-cli open --browser=webkit
playwright-cli open --browser=msedge

# Emulate a generic mobile device (Pixel 10 for Chromium, iPhone 17 for WebKit).
# Prefer this when a mobile layout is acceptable: mobile pages are usually
# lighter, so snapshots are smaller and cheaper.
playwright-cli open --mobile
playwright-cli open --device="iPhone 15"

# Use persistent profile (by default profile is in-memory)
playwright-cli open --persistent
# Use persistent profile with custom directory
playwright-cli open --profile=/path/to/profile

# Connect to browser via Playwright Extension
playwright-cli attach --extension=chrome

# Connect to a running Chrome or Edge by channel name
playwright-cli attach --cdp=chrome
playwright-cli attach --cdp=msedge

# Connect to a running browser via CDP endpoint
playwright-cli attach --cdp=http://localhost:9222

# Start with config file
playwright-cli open --config=my-config.json

# Close only a browser this task opened
playwright-cli close
# Detach from an attached browser (leaves the external browser running)
playwright-cli detach
# Delete only task-owned profile data, with user approval
playwright-cli delete-data
```

## URLs with `&` on Windows

On Windows, protect `&` from the shell when a URL has multiple query
parameters. In `cmd.exe`, quote the URL without adding a caret inside quotes:

```batch
playwright-cli goto "https://example.com/?a=1&b=2"
```

In PowerShell on Windows, use `--%` to stop argument parsing:

```powershell
playwright-cli --% goto "https://example.com/?a=1&b=2"
```

## Snapshots

After each command, playwright-cli provides a snapshot of the current browser state.

```text
> playwright-cli goto https://example.com
### Page
- Page URL: https://example.com/
- Page Title: Example Domain
### Snapshot
[Snapshot](.playwright-cli/page-2026-02-14T19-22-42-679Z.yml)
```

You can also take a snapshot on demand using `playwright-cli snapshot` command. All the options below can be combined as needed.

```bash
# default - save to a file with timestamp-based name
playwright-cli snapshot

# save to file, use when snapshot is a part of the workflow result
playwright-cli snapshot --filename=after-click.yaml

# snapshot an element instead of the whole page
playwright-cli snapshot "#main"

# limit snapshot depth for efficiency, take a partial snapshot afterwards
playwright-cli snapshot --depth=4
playwright-cli snapshot e34

# include each element's bounding box as [box=x,y,width,height]
playwright-cli snapshot --boxes

# search a large snapshot instead of capturing it all — returns matching nodes
# with 3 lines of context around each match (like grep -C)
playwright-cli find "Add to cart"
playwright-cli find --regex '\$[0-9]+\.[0-9]{2}'
```

## Targeting elements

By default, use refs from the snapshot to interact with page elements.

```bash
# get snapshot with refs
playwright-cli snapshot

# interact using a ref
playwright-cli click e15
```

You can also use css selectors or Playwright locators.

```bash
# css selector
playwright-cli click "#main > button.submit"

# role locator
playwright-cli click "getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })"

# test id
playwright-cli click "getByTestId('submit-button')"
```

## Installation

If the global command is unavailable, check for a local version without installing:

```bash
npx --no-install playwright --version
```

When a local version supports the CLI, use `npx --no-install playwright cli`
in place of `playwright-cli`. Otherwise, report the missing tool and ask before
installing: the npm grant covers project commands, and a global install changes
the machine. Only after approval:

```bash
npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
```

## Example: Form submission

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com/form
playwright-cli snapshot

playwright-cli fill e1 "user@example.com"
playwright-cli fill e2 "password123"
playwright-cli click e3
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli close
```

## Example: Multi-tab workflow

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli tab-new https://example.com/other
playwright-cli tab-list
playwright-cli tab-select 0
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli close
```

## Example: Debugging with DevTools

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli click e4
playwright-cli fill e7 "test"
playwright-cli console
playwright-cli requests
playwright-cli close
```

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli tracing-start
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli click e4
playwright-cli fill e7 "test"
playwright-cli tracing-stop
playwright-cli close
```

## Example: Interactive session

Ask the user for UI review or design feedback. The user draws boxes on the live page and types comments; you receive the annotated screenshot, the snapshot of the marked region, and the user's notes. Use this whenever the user asks for "UI review", "design feedback", or to "ask the user what they think / want / mean":

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli show --annotate
```
