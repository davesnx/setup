# Plannotator Last

Use this skill when the user wants to annotate the latest assistant response in Plannotator.

Do not send a commentary/status message before running the command. The command
targets the latest rendered assistant response, so a preamble can mistakenly become the
thing being annotated.

Run:

```bash
plannotator last
```

Behavior:

1. Launch the command with Bash.
2. Wait for the annotation session to finish.
3. If feedback is returned, incorporate it into the follow-up response.
4. If the session closes without feedback, mention that briefly and continue.
5. An approval may still carry notes — a `"decision": "approved"` result with a
   `"feedback"` field. Read those notes and carry them into subsequent work, but
   do not redo the message over them: they are guidance, not a change request.

Run the command yourself rather than telling the user to invoke shell syntax manually.
