# Onboarding — generate your skin from a design source

**Goal:** point the skill at a design source — a website, an installed skill, or a local folder — and have it extract the palette + typography, then rewrite `style-guide.md` so every future diagram inherits that skin.

Takes about 60 seconds.

Three source methods are supported. Jump to the relevant section:

- [§ URL](#url) — fetch a live website
- [§ Skill](#skill) — read an installed Agent Skill that carries design tokens
- [§ Folder](#folder) — read a local design-system directory (CSS, JSON, Markdown)

---

## The flow (all methods)

```
Source you provide (URL / skill name / folder path)
      ↓
[1] read / fetch the source
      ↓
[2] extract dominant colors + fonts
      ↓
[3] map to semantic roles (paper, ink, muted, accent, …)
      ↓
[4] propose a style-guide.md diff
      ↓
[5] write the diff (with your approval)
      ↓
[6] offer to save as a named client profile
      ↓
future diagrams use your tokens
```

Gate-only choices use the same finish:

- **(d) Manual:** accept the user's tokens, write them under a new `Custom tokens` section in `style-guide.md`, then offer to save a named profile.
- **(e) Default:** proceed with the shipped skin. To persist that choice for this project, offer to write a `.diagram-design` marker containing exactly `profile: default`; write it only with explicit consent.

## § URL

### Invocation

> *"Onboard diagram-design to my site — `https://example.com`"*

---

### Step 1 — fetch the page

Use `agent-browser` (preferred) or a plain `fetch`. If the site has multiple pages worth sampling (landing + blog + product), fetch 2–3 and merge the palette signals.

```bash
agent-browser navigate https://example.com --screenshot out.png --html out.html
```

---

## Step 2 — extract colors and fonts

### Colors

Parse the rendered CSS and screenshot:

- **Background color** of `<body>` or the dominant large region → `paper`
- **Primary text color** (body text) → `ink`
- **Secondary text color** (captions, meta) → `muted`
- **Most-used brand color** (CTA button, link, heading accent) → `accent`
- **Container / card background** slightly darker than paper → `paper-2`
- **Border / hairline color** → `rule` (convert to rgba of ink at ~0.12 opacity)

Prefer CSS custom properties when the site exposes them (`:root { --accent: …; }`). Otherwise pull via rendered `getComputedStyle` samples or a color-histogram pass over the screenshot.

### Fonts

Read the rendered `font-family` stack of:

- `<h1>` → `title` family
- `<body>` → `node-name` family  
- `<code>`, `<pre>`, or any mono-styled element → `sublabel` family

If the site has only one family, keep the schematic defaults for the missing roles (Instrument Serif for title, Geist Mono for mono). Don't force-pick a mono font that isn't on the site.

### Exact-font gate for brand-matched output

Do not replace a detected brand family with `serif`, `system-ui`, or `ui-monospace` merely to make the file dependency-free. A public font is part of the visual system.

1. Record the computed family and weight used by the sampled heading, body, and technical-label elements.
2. Trace each family to its source: an existing Google Fonts stylesheet, an installed/system stack, or a custom-hosted `@font-face`.
3. If it is available through Google Fonts, carry the exact family name, weights, and approved stylesheet into the style guide and generated HTML. The single-file allowlist accepts only a parsed HTTPS URL whose hostname is exactly `fonts.googleapis.com` and whose path is exactly `/css2`; prefix/lookalike hosts and other paths fail. Preserve an intentional system stack in order and verify the resolved family on the target machine.
4. A custom-hosted or paid font is not compatible with the default single-file allowlist. Label that role `fallback` unless the user separately approves and packages the font; never silently add a remote font URL or claim an exact match.
5. Verify the rendered output with `getComputedStyle`; a declared family that failed to load does not pass.

For a page containing bespoke diagrams or editorial figures, inspect their rendered font roles as well as the surrounding article. A figure-specific stylesheet may intentionally differ from the site's global heading/body stack.

---

## Step 3 — map to semantic roles

Propose a diff by filling this table:

| Role | Detected | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| paper | `#f8f6f0` | high |
| ink | `#111111` | high |
| muted | `#6b6b68` | medium |
| accent | `#c73a2b` | high |
| … | … | … |

Flag low-confidence guesses so the user can correct before applying.

### Constraint checks

Before writing, validate:

- **AA contrast**: `ink` on `paper` ≥ 4.5:1. `muted` on `paper` ≥ 4.5:1 for body text.
- **Accent is the most saturated color**: not muted-ish, not near-grey.
- **paper ≠ pure white**: if the site uses `#ffffff`, fall back to `#fafaf7` to preserve Diagram Design's warm-neutral feel — or ask the user to confirm pure-white is intentional.

If any check fails, propose an adjusted value and explain why.

---

## Step 4 — preview the diff

Show the user what will change in `style-guide.md`. Only the tokens table — everything else stays the same.

```diff
-| `paper`  | `#f5f4ed` | `#1c1a17` |
-| `ink`    | `#0b0d0b` | `#f1efe7` |
-| `accent` | `#f7591f` | `#ff6a30` |
+| `paper`  | `#f8f6f0` | `#1a1815` |
+| `ink`    | `#111111` | `#efeee7` |
+| `accent` | `#c73a2b` | `#e05440` |
```

Also regenerate the dark variant via the inversion rule (`rgba(11,13,11, X)` → `rgba(ink-rgb, X)`).

Include a compact **brand fidelity receipt** with the preview:

- sampled URLs;
- detected paper, ink, muted, accent, surface, and rule values;
- title, body, and technical-label families with weights and source URLs;
- `exact` or `fallback` for each font role;
- any page-specific figure styling that should override the global site skin.

The receipt is required when the user says “match this site,” “use their branding,” or provides a page as the visual reference.

---

## Step 5 — apply

Before overwriting a still-pristine guide, create the recoverable `default` snapshot if it does not exist, following [`profiles.md`](profiles.md). Retain the pre-diff body for that snapshot; never snapshot newly customized tokens as `default`.

Write the new tokens to `style-guide.md`. Suggest running the `/regenerate-examples` flow (if it exists) or rebuilding one example to verify the new skin reads cleanly.

After onboarding, the user should:

1. Open `assets/index.html` (gallery) and confirm the new palette feels coherent across all 39 types.
2. If any type looks off, they usually need to tune `muted` (often too dark or too light against the new `paper`).

---

## When URL onboarding fails

- **Site uses webfonts you can't replicate** (custom-hosted, paid): keep the schematic defaults for typography and skin only the colors.
- **Brand has 6+ colors** and you can't identify a clear hierarchy: pick one as `accent`, demote the rest to `muted` variants or ignore them. The schematic grammar only uses 5–7 roles.
- **Site is dark-mode first**: flip the inversion — treat their dark paper as the default `paper`, and generate a light variant via inversion.
- **Homepage is all imagery, no text**: ask for a blog or docs URL instead — text-heavy pages expose the type hierarchy.

---

## § Skill

Extract tokens from an installed Agent Skill that carries its own design system (e.g. a `brand-design` or `ui-kit` skill).

### Invocation

> *"Onboard diagram-design from my `acme-design` skill"*

Or the gate offers this as option (b) and the user names the skill.

### Step 1 — locate the skill

Use the installed-skill location exposed by the current agent when available. Otherwise search locations for the active harness:

**Pi:**

1. `~/.pi/agent/skills/<skill-name>/` and `~/.agents/skills/<skill-name>/` (user installs)
2. `.pi/skills/<skill-name>/` in the current directory, plus `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/` from the current directory through the repo root (project installs)
3. Package paths listed in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` or `.pi/settings.json`; managed packages live under `~/.pi/agent/git/`, `~/.pi/agent/npm/`, `.pi/git/`, or `.pi/npm/`

**Claude Code:**

1. `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/` (user install)
2. `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/` (project install)

**Factory Droid:**

1. `~/.factory/skills/<skill-name>/` (personal install)
2. `.factory/skills/<skill-name>/` from the current directory through the repo root (folder-specific or project install)
3. The active path shown in `/skills` under **Plugins**; installed plugins keep the shared `skills/<skill-name>/` directory inside Droid's plugin cache

Finally, check any path the user provides explicitly. If the skill is still not found, ask the user to confirm the name or provide its path.

### Step 2 — read token sources

Glob the skill directory for any of these files and read them all:

| Priority | Pattern | What to look for |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `*.css`, `colors*.css`, `tokens.css` | CSS custom properties in `:root { --color-*: …; }` |
| 2 | `tokens.json`, `design-tokens.json`, `*.tokens.json` | Style Dictionary / Figma token JSON |
| 3 | `SKILL.md`, `README.md` | Markdown tables listing colors, fonts, hex values |
| 4 | `style-guide.md`, `*design*.md` | Any narrative design documentation |
| 5 | `*.html` (preview/example files) | Inline `<style>` blocks — scan `:root` and `body` rules |

Read all matches and merge — CSS custom properties take priority over inferred values from HTML.

### Step 3 — extract colors and fonts

**From CSS custom properties:**
Map variable names to semantic roles using name-heuristics:

| If the variable name contains… | Map to role |
|---|---|
| `background`, `bg`, `paper`, `surface`, `canvas` | `paper` |
| `foreground`, `text`, `body`, `ink`, `on-surface` | `ink` |
| `muted`, `subtle`, `secondary`, `caption` | `muted` |
| `accent`, `brand`, `primary`, `cta`, `highlight` | `accent` |
| `border`, `rule`, `divider`, `outline` | `rule` |
| `mono`, `code`, `pre` | `sublabel` font |

**From JSON tokens:** follow the same heuristics on key names. If the JSON follows Style Dictionary format (`{ "color": { "brand": { "value": "#…" } } }`), flatten the path and apply heuristics to the leaf key.

**From Markdown tables:** look for rows with hex values (`#rrggbb`) adjacent to role-like words. A row like `| accent | #eb6c36 |` maps directly.

**Fonts:** look for `font-family` rules, `@import` or `@font-face` declarations, and Markdown mentions of font names alongside size/weight.

### Step 4 — map, validate, propose diff

Same as the URL method: fill the role table, run contrast checks, show the diff, ask for approval before writing.

### When skill extraction is ambiguous

- **Skill has no CSS or token files**: fall back to reading all `.md` files and look for hex values mentioned in prose. Surface what you found and ask the user to confirm mappings before applying.
- **Multiple accent candidates**: list them and ask the user to pick one. Don't guess.
- **Skill is dark-mode first**: ask whether to treat the dark values as the `paper`/`ink` defaults or to invert.

---

## § Folder

Extract tokens from a local directory — a checked-out design system repo, a Figma export, or any folder the user points you at.

### Invocation

> *"Onboard diagram-design from my design system at `~/projects/brand/design-tokens/`"*

Or the gate offers this as option (c) and the user provides the path.

### Step 1 — discover files

Glob the folder (recursively, up to 3 levels deep) for:

```
**/*.css
**/*.scss        (read @forward / $variable declarations)
**/tokens.json
**/*.tokens.json
**/design-tokens.json
**/colors.json
**/*style-guide*.md
**/*design-system*.md
**/README.md
**/*.html        (scan <style> blocks only)
```

If the result set is large (>20 files), prefer files in the root and files whose names contain `color`, `token`, `brand`, `palette`, `style`, or `theme`.

### Step 2 — read and merge

Read every discovered file. Apply the same extraction logic as the Skill method (§ Skill → Step 3). CSS custom properties and JSON tokens take priority over inferred values from prose.

**SCSS variables:** treat `$variable-name: value;` the same as a CSS custom property — apply name heuristics to `$variable-name`.

**Figma token JSON** (Figma Tokens Plugin format):

```json
{ "colors": { "brand": { "primary": { "value": "#eb6c36", "type": "color" } } } }
```

Walk the tree; the leaf `value` fields are the colors, the path segments supply the role heuristic.

### Step 3 — map, validate, propose diff

Same as the URL method: run contrast checks, show the full diff against current `style-guide.md`, and write only after the user approves.

### When folder extraction is ambiguous

- **No structured token files, only prose docs**: read every `.md` in the root and extract hex values found near role-like words. Show the user a table of what you inferred — don't silently apply uncertain mappings.
- **Multiple themes / color schemes found**: list them, ask the user which one to use as the diagram skin.
- **Folder has zero readable files**: tell the user and ask for a more specific path or switch to manual token entry.

## Multiple clients? Save a profile

After every onboarding method, offer to save the completed guide as a named client profile. Follow [`profiles.md`](profiles.md) for the canonical home-directory library, metadata header, strict slug validation, and project marker. A project with a `.diagram-design` marker reads its profile directly, so parallel client workspaces do not overwrite one shared working copy.
